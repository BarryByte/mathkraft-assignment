# Fractions Game - Problem Statement

## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive educational game focused on teaching and reinforcing fraction concepts through an engaging, visually appealing interface.

## Game Design Reference
Design Mockup: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/MNBVvPXRRDYXtI8jk9ogzA/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=wyhaXPzmBdf7RM2n-1)

## Problem Domain
The game is designed to help students (primarily elementary and middle school levels) understand and practice conversion of mixed fraction to improper fraction.

## Key Objectives
1. **Educational Goal**: 
   - Teach fraction concepts through interactive gameplay
   - Provide visual representations of mixed fractions

## Setup
This is a standard React Next.js project. You can install the modules using `npm install` followed by starting up the server using `npm run dev`.

## Technical Requirements
- Responsive React web-based game
- Build on top of the started template provided
- Use the Figma design as a reference
- Use the variables in the `game/game-state.tsx` file as the game state
- Use the `game/state-utils.tsx` file to manage the game state
- Stick to the screen and step structure in the `game/game-state.tsx` file, screen notation is well defined in the Figma design, use step as per your need to navigate through the game
- Use modular components for the game screens, and the components should be in the `game/components` folder

## Submissions
- Create a fork of the repository
- Make the necessary changes to the code
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository
  - Mention you name and email id in the PR comments.


## Guidelines
- Don't spend more than 2 days on the assignment.
- You can explore all the libraries and frameworks you want.
- Keep the game light weight and don't over complicate the implementation.
- We'd prefer a good game with just one screen over a average game with all three screens
- Submission will be judged on the following criteria:
  - Code quality and modularity
  - Game design and functionality
  - User experience
