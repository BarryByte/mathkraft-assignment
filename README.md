# Fractions Game - Problem Statement

## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive educational game focused on teaching and reinforcing fraction concepts through an engaging, visually appealing interface.

## Game Design Reference
Design Mockup: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/MNBVvPXRRDYXtI8jk9ogzA/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=wyhaXPzmBdf7RM2n-1)

## Problem Domain
The game is designed to help students (primarily elementary and middle school levels) understand and practice fraction manipulation, comparison, and visualization.

## Key Objectives
1. **Educational Goal**: 
   - Teach fraction concepts through interactive gameplay
   - Provide visual representations of mixed fractions

## Technical Requirements
- Responsive React web-based game
- Build on top of the started template provided
- Use the Figma design as a reference
- Use the variables in the `game/game-state.tsx` file as the game state
- Use the `game/state-utils.tsx` file to manage the game state
- Stick to the screen and step structure in the `game/game-state.tsx` file, screen notation is well defined in the Figma design, use step as per your need to navigate through the game
- Use modular components for the game screens, and the components should be in the `game/components` folder
